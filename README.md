# Personal Android Projects
This repo contains the source to some of my Android projects, that I just created for fun, through freelancing and for other reasons. 

## Aathmasparan
Aathmasparan is a non-profit organization established in Chennai in the year 2012 to serve as a bridge between patients and blood donors. This application that I made for Aathmasparan has facilities to connect with a donor database based in Chennai, India. You can register as donors, you can access the contact details of already registered donors, gain knowledge about the blood donation process and such. You can also create donor accounts and login into your profile to update your details. 

*Tech stuff: Java/XML for the app, PHP/MySQL for the backend.*

## Basic Stuff

#### Calculator
A simple calculator with the 4 basic operations + - * and /. #FirstBase

#### Temperature Convertor
My First Android Application! Converts temperature from degC to degF and vice-versa. #FirstBase

#### Toggle Visibility
Makes a TextView visible and invisible alternatively on a button click. #FirstBase

#### iClub Gallery
A simple gallery of ImageViews with the photos of our team - the Innovation club. #FirstBase

#### Bingo
The Bingo Game! This was one of the first apps that I developed. The usual bingo game. Nothing special about it, really. #FirstBase

##Cognit
Cognit is an annual technical symposium of my college, MNM Jain Engineering College, Chennai, India. In a (successful) attempt to digitize all the activities in the symposium, I developed an application that allows the visitors to register for the 10s of events on the day of the symposium. This replaced the traditional way of my college's pen and papaer on-spot registration. For the 2013 edition of the symposium, I created a simple informational application. It was for the 2014 edition, that I created the online registration app.

*Tech stuff: Java/XML for the app, PHP/MySQL for the backend.*

##International Birthday Reminder

An Application for birthday reminders. Just with a little different touch! I find it hard to remember birthdays of the loved ones in a different Time Zone - to send my wishes at 00:00. This application (which is in progress) will let you set the timezone of your loved one, and it will remind you in your time to wish him/her at 00:00. 

##St. Joseph's - Workshop Stuff

In February 2014, a friend and I conducted a week-long workshop on Android Developmemnt on behalf of [Stigmata Techno Solutions](http://www.stigmata.co.in) in St.Joseph's College of Engineering, Chennai, India. We covered the basics and some advanced topics, for a class of 30 junior undergraduate students. This repo has the contents of the study material that I created for this sake and a lot of sample applications that I created during the workshop to demonstrate the concepts. 

*Tech stuff: Used [Reveal JS](http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/#/) - a HTML Presentation Framework - for the presentations. And of course, Java/XML for the apps.*
