# Personal Android Projects
This repo contains the source to some of my Android projects, that I just created for fun - not part of any coursework or anything else.


## Aathmasparan
Aathmasparan is a non-profit organization established in Chennai in the year 2012 to serve as a bridge between patients and blood donors. This application that I made for Aathmasparan has facilities to connect with a donor database based in Chennai, India. You can register as donors, you can access the contact details of already registered donors, gain knowledge about the blood donation process and such. You can also create donor accounts and login into your profile to update your details. 

*Tech stuff: Java/XML for the app, PHP/MySQL for the backend.*

## Bingo
The Bingo Game! This was one of the first apps that I developed. The usual bingo game. Nothing special about it, really. #FirstBase

##Cognit
Cognit is an annual technical symposium of my college, MNM Jain Engineering College, Chennai, India. In a (successful) attempt to digitize all the activities in the symposium, I developed an application that allows the visitors to register for the 10s of events on the day of the symposium. This replaced the traditional way of my college's pen and papaer on-spot registration.
